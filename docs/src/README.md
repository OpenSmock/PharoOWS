## Welcome to PharoOWS documentation.

A variety of protocols and standards exist to enable communication with map
servers and access geographic data in both raster and vector formats. Defined
by the [Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)](https://www.ogc.org/), these
protocols are fondamental to ensure interoperability between clients and
servers.

PharoOWS supports the official OGC protocols along with some widely adopted de
facto standards, offering tools for querying map servers and parsing the
returned data.


## Overview of supported protocols and standards

PharoOWS is split into several packages according to the supported protocols
and standards:

| Package 	| Type 	                | Supported Protocols |	Status         |
|---------------|-----------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| OWS-TMS 	| De facto standard     | TMS 	              | In development |
| OWS-Service 	| Official OGC 	        | WMS, WMTS 	      | In development |
| OWS-API 	| Official OGC (modern) | OGC API - Processes |	Upcoming       |


ðŸ“¢ PharoOWS is still in development, so new protocols and standards will be added over time.
