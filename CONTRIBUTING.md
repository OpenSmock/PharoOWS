The code is licensed under MIT (see LICENSE for details).

First of all, thanks for contributing!

This document provides some basic guidelines for contributing to this repository. To propose improvements, feel free to submit a PR.

## Submitting issues

* If you think you've found an issue, search the issue list to see if there's an existing issue.
* Then, if you find nothing, open a GitHub issue.

## Pull Requests

If your change concern the collection in itself we're more than happy to review your contribution in this repository!

In order to ease/speed up our review, here are some items you can check/improve when submitting your PR:

  * Have a proper commit history (we advise you to rebase if needed).
  * Summarize your PR with an explanatory title and a message describing your changes, cross-referencing any related bugs/PRs.
  * Open your PR against the `master` branch.

### Keep it small, focused

Avoid changing too many things at once. For instance, if you're fixing a role and at the same time adding some code refactor, it makes reviewing harder and the _time-to-release_ longer.

### Commit messages

Please take a moment to write meaningful commit messages.

The commit message should describe the reason for the change and give extra
details that will allow someone later on to understand in 5 seconds the thing
you've been working on for a day.

### Squash your commits

Rebase your changes on `master` and squash your commits whenever possible. This
keeps history cleaner and easier to revert things. It also makes developers
happier!

## Development

To contribute, follow the contributing guidelines above.




# Contributing


This project is licensed under the MIT License (see LICENSE for details).

First off, thanks for your interest in contributing!

This document outlines basic guidelines to help you contribute effectively. To
suggest improvements, feel free to open a pull request (PR).


## Submitting issues

1. Think you've found a bug or problem? Start by searching the existing issues
   to avoid duplicates.
2. If nothing matches, go ahead and open a new issue on GitHub.


## Pull Requests

If your change directly impacts the collection, we’re happy to review your
contribution!

To help streamline the review process, please consider the following when
submitting your PR:

- Keep a clean commit history (rebasing is encouraged when appropriate).
- Provide a clear PR title and description, referencing any related issues or
  PRs.
- Submit your PR against the master branch.

Keep it small, focused

Try not to bundle multiple unrelated changes into one PR. For example, avoid
combining a bug fix with a code refactor — it makes reviewing harder and delays
the release.


## Commit messages

Write clear and meaningful commit messages.

Each message should explain why the change was made and include enough detail
to help future developers understand your work in seconds — even if it took you
all day.


## Squash your commits

Before submitting, rebase your changes onto master and squash your commits when
possible. This keeps the project history clean, easier to review, and more
maintainable.

Happy developers appreciate clean histories.


## Development

To start contributing, just follow the guidelines above.
